# Accredian Refer & Earn Frontend

**NOTE:** This repo contains a coding task I completed as part of an application process. Archived for reference.

## Overview

This project is a simple web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Material UI](https://mui.com/) designed for a "Refer & Earn" program. Users can refer friends to Accredian courses and, if their friends enroll, both parties receive a reward.

### Features

- **Referral Submission:** Users can submit referrals by filling out a form.
- **Reward Workflow:** Once a referral joins an Accredian program, both the referrer and the referee get a bonus after 30 days.
- **How It Works Section:** Explains the steps of the referral process.
- **Modern UI:** Uses Material UI and Google Fonts for a clean, responsive interface.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
